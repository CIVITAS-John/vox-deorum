# FLAVOR_GOLD

## Overview

`FLAVOR_GOLD` is an AI personality flavor that controls how strongly a civilization's leader prioritizes gold generation and economic wealth accumulation. This flavor fundamentally shapes the AI's approach to economic development, influencing building construction, technology research, trade route establishment, policy selection, and diplomatic interactions with minor civilizations.

Unlike `FLAVOR_PRODUCTION` (which focuses on manufacturing capacity) or `FLAVOR_GROWTH` (which focuses on population), `FLAVOR_GOLD` specifically drives the AI's **commitment to accumulating wealth** through gold-generating buildings (markets, banks, stock exchanges), trade routes, economic tile improvements, and economic policies.

### Value Range
- **Scale:** 0-10 (integer values)
- **Typical Values:**
  - Trade/economic-focused leaders: 8-10
  - Balanced leaders: 5-7
  - Military/production-focused leaders: 3-5
  - Leaders during economic crises: Temporarily increased by 30-60

## Code References

### 1. Advisor Recommendation System (CvAdvisorRecommender.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvAdvisorRecommender.cpp` (lines 318-321)

**Function:** `CvAdvisorRecommender::GetRecommendationPriority()`

FLAVOR_GOLD has the highest priority weight among economic flavors for advisor recommendations.

```cpp
else if(strFlavorName == "FLAVOR_GOLD")
{
    return 23;
}
```

**Interpretation:** FLAVOR_GOLD receives a priority weight of 23, making it the absolute highest priority economic flavor in the advisor recommendation system (higher than production at 16, growth at 15, and infrastructure at 9). The economic advisor will strongly and frequently recommend gold-enhancing buildings, improvements, and strategies to civilizations with high gold flavors.

**Strategic Impact:** Gold-focused leaders will receive constant advisor recommendations to build markets, banks, stock exchanges, establish trade routes, and pursue economic technologies and policies.

### 2. Builder (Worker) Tasking - Gold Improvement Priority (CvBuilderTaskingAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvBuilderTaskingAI.cpp` (lines 2698-2703)

**Function:** `CvBuilderTaskingAI::ScorePlot()`

FLAVOR_GOLD determines how workers prioritize building improvements that increase gold yield.

```cpp
case YIELD_GOLD:
    if(GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop) == "FLAVOR_GOLD")
    {
        iYieldDifferenceWeight += iDeltaYield * pFlavorManager->GetPersonalityIndividualFlavor((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop)
            * /*2*/ GD_INT_GET(BUILDER_TASKING_PLOT_EVAL_MULTIPLIER_GOLD);
    }
    break;
```

**Interpretation:** When workers evaluate which tiles to improve, FLAVOR_GOLD multiplies the gold yield improvement value by both the flavor value and a configurable multiplier (default 2). This means:
- A leader with FLAVOR_GOLD = 9 will value a +2 gold improvement as: 2 × 9 × 2 = 36 points
- A leader with FLAVOR_GOLD = 3 will value it as: 2 × 3 × 2 = 12 points

**Practical Effect:** High-gold leaders will prioritize building trading posts, plantations on luxury resources, and mines on gold/silver deposits over farms and other improvements. Workers will improve gold resources, jungle trading posts, and coastal luxury resources before food or production tiles when FLAVOR_GOLD is high.

### 3. City Specialization - Gold Focus (CvCitySpecializationAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvCitySpecializationAI.cpp` (lines 456-457)

**Function:** `CvCitySpecializationAI::LogSpecializationUpdate()`

FLAVOR_GOLD influences long-term city specialization decisions, determining whether cities should focus on gold generation.

```cpp
int iFlavorGold = 10 * m_pPlayer->GetGrandStrategyAI()->GetPersonalityAndGrandStrategy(
    (FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_GOLD"));
if (iFlavorGold < 0) iFlavorGold = 0;
```

**Interpretation:** The gold flavor is multiplied by 10 and combined with the active grand strategy to create a city specialization weight. This means:
- FLAVOR_GOLD = 7 adds 70 weight toward gold-focused specialization
- Cities will prioritize buildings, specialists, and citizen assignments that maximize gold output
- Gold-specialized cities will work more gold tiles (trading posts, luxury resources, coastal tiles) while avoiding food and production tiles until economic goals are met

**Strategic Impact:** Gold-specialized cities become dedicated economic centers that generate substantial wealth for purchasing units, buildings, city-state influence, and maintaining large standing armies.

### 4. City-State Interaction - Economic Diplomacy (CvDiplomacyAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvDiplomacyAI.cpp` (line 32092)

**Function:** `CvDiplomacyAI::DoContactMinorCivs()`

FLAVOR_GOLD heavily influences city-state interaction strategies, particularly gold gifting and quest priorities.

```cpp
int iDiplomacyFlavor = GetPlayer()->GetGrandStrategyAI()->GetPersonalityAndGrandStrategy(
    (FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_DIPLOMACY"));
int iGoldFlavor = GetPlayer()->GetGrandStrategyAI()->GetPersonalityAndGrandStrategy(
    (FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_GOLD"));
int iTileImprovementFlavor = GetPlayer()->GetGrandStrategyAI()->GetPersonalityAndGrandStrategy(
    (FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_TILE_IMPROVEMENT"));
```

**Interpretation:** FLAVOR_GOLD is one of three key flavors used in city-state interaction decisions. Leaders with high FLAVOR_GOLD will:
- Invest more gold in city-state gifting to secure alliances and bonuses
- Prioritize mercantile and trade city-states that provide gold bonuses
- Value city-states with trade route bonuses and economic benefits
- Complete gold-related quests from city-states more frequently
- Use accumulated wealth for diplomatic influence

**Strategic Impact:** Gold-focused leaders build diplomatic networks through economic investment, creating a network of allied city-states that provide additional economic bonuses, trade route slots, and luxury resources.

## City Strategy Adjustments

### Happiness Crisis - Gold Strategy (StrategyChanges.sql)

**Location:** `(2) Vox Populi/Database Changes/AI/StrategyChanges.sql` (lines 44-46)

**Function:** City-level strategy adjustments during happiness crises

FLAVOR_GOLD temporarily **increases dramatically** during happiness crisis strategies, causing the AI to build gold infrastructure to purchase happiness solutions.

```sql
('AICITYSTRATEGY_NEED_HAPPINESS_GOLD', 'FLAVOR_GOLD', 60),
('AICITYSTRATEGY_NEED_HAPPINESS_GOLD', 'FLAVOR_GROWTH', 30),
('AICITYSTRATEGY_NEED_HAPPINESS_GOLD', 'FLAVOR_I_LAND_TRADE_ROUTE', 30),
('AICITYSTRATEGY_NEED_HAPPINESS_GOLD', 'FLAVOR_I_SEA_TRADE_ROUTE', 30),
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Need Happiness (Gold):** +60 FLAVOR_GOLD - Massive economic boost to generate gold for purchasing happiness buildings and luxuries
- **Growth Synergy:** +30 FLAVOR_GROWTH - Grow cities to generate more gold from population
- **Trade Route Synergy:** +30 to both land and sea trade route flavors - Establish trade routes to generate additional gold income

**Strategic Response:** When cities face happiness crises requiring economic solutions, FLAVOR_GOLD increases by 60 points. This represents the AI's recognition that it must:
- Build markets, banks, and stock exchanges to generate gold
- Establish trade routes for additional income
- Purchase happiness buildings (theaters, stadiums, zoos) with accumulated gold
- Buy luxuries from other civilizations through trade deals
- Generate enough income to maintain economic stability

**Practical Effect:** Cities in happiness crisis will prioritize economic infrastructure over military or production buildings, working gold tiles and establishing trade routes to generate the wealth needed to purchase happiness solutions.

## Design Philosophy

FLAVOR_GOLD represents the AI's fundamental approach to wealth accumulation and economic power:

1. **Economic Infrastructure:** What to build (markets, banks, trade buildings vs military/production buildings)
2. **Trade Strategy:** How aggressively to establish and protect trade routes
3. **Diplomatic Investment:** How much to invest in city-state alliances and diplomatic relationships
4. **Purchase Strategy:** Whether to save gold for emergency purchases or maintain reserves

This creates a spectrum of AI economic development strategies:

- **High GOLD (8-10):** Economic powerhouses who maximize gold generation, build extensive trade networks, dominate diplomatic relationships through wealth, and can purchase armies or buildings as needed
- **Moderate GOLD (5-7):** Balanced leaders who maintain healthy economies while also investing in production, military, and science
- **Low GOLD (2-4):** Military or production-focused leaders who accept lower gold income to prioritize hammers or conquest
- **Economic Crisis (temporarily increased):** All leaders temporarily become more gold-focused during happiness crises to purchase solutions

- **High Gold + High Trade Routes:** Trade-focused empires that dominate economic networks (Portugal, Morocco)
- **High Gold + Low Production:** Economic civilizations that purchase what they can't build (Venice, Arabia)
- **Low Gold + High Production:** Self-sufficient military civilizations that build rather than buy (Germany, Rome)

## Interaction with Game Mechanics

### Trade Route Management
FLAVOR_GOLD heavily influences trade route decisions:
- Leaders with FLAVOR_GOLD ≥ 7 will maximize trade route capacity
- Trade routes are redirected toward gold-generating destinations over food/production
- Cargo ships are prioritized over caravans when coastal trade routes are available
- Trade route protection becomes high military priority

### City-State Diplomacy
Gold-focused leaders excel at city-state relationships:
- Willing to spend 30-50% of gold reserves on city-state influence
- Prioritize mercantile city-states for additional gold and luxuries
- Complete economic quests from city-states more frequently
- Establish protective pacts with economically valuable city-states

### Purchase Strategy
High gold flavor enables aggressive purchase strategy:
- Purchase units for immediate military needs during warfare
- Purchase buildings in newly founded cities to accelerate development
- Purchase great people improvements when opportunities arise
- Maintain gold reserves for emergency defensive purchases

### Happiness Management
FLAVOR_GOLD provides alternative happiness solutions:
- Purchase happiness buildings (theaters, stadiums, zoos) rather than building them
- Buy luxuries from other civilizations through trade agreements
- Generate wealth to support larger military forces (unit maintenance costs)
- Fund cultural buildings and wonders that provide happiness

### Corporate Strategy
In late-game, FLAVOR_GOLD influences corporate strategy:
- Gold-focused leaders prioritize Trader Sid's and Civilized Jewelers corporations
- Corporate offices and headquarters with high FLAVOR_GOLD values are built in economic centers
- Corporate franchises are valued based on gold bonuses they provide
- Trade routes between corporate franchises maximize economic output

This creates a comprehensive economic strategy where gold-focused civilizations build economic empires that fund diplomatic influence, military power, and rapid infrastructure development through purchasing rather than production.
