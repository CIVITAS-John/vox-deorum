# FLAVOR_RANGED

## Overview

FLAVOR_RANGED is an AI personality flavor in Civilization V that controls the AI's preference for ranged combat units and ranged combat tactics. This flavor influences decisions across multiple AI subsystems including unit production, military strategy, technology research, building construction, and unit promotion selection.

The flavor value typically ranges from 1-20 for individual leaders, with the AI dynamically adjusting this value based on strategic circumstances through various military and economic strategies.

## Core Functionality

### Unit Composition Strategy

FLAVOR_RANGED directly determines the desired ratio of ranged units to total military forces:

- **Target Ratio**: The AI aims for a ranged unit ratio equal to `FLAVOR_RANGED * 10%` of total military units
- **"Need Ranged" Strategy**: Triggered when ranged ratio falls below `FLAVOR_RANGED / 2 * 10%`
- **"Enough Ranged" Strategy**: Triggered when ranged ratio reaches or exceeds `FLAVOR_RANGED * 10%`

For example, a leader with FLAVOR_RANGED = 8 will:
- Target 80% ranged units in their army composition
- Need more ranged units if ratio drops below 40%
- Stop prioritizing ranged units at 80%+

### Unit Promotion Selection

FLAVOR_RANGED significantly influences AI promotion choices for both ranged and melee units. The flavor value (clamped to 1-20) is used in weighted calculations for:

- **Range bonuses**: Value scales with `3 * iFlavorRanged * 100 / currentRange`
- **Indirect Fire ability**: Value = `(iFlavorRanged * 2 + iFlavorOffense) * 20 * range`
- **Fortification attack bonuses**: For ranged units, value = `(bonus) * (2 * iFlavorRanged + iFlavorOffense) * 0.3`
- **Nearby enemy combat modifiers**: Value = `range * (iFlavorOffense + 2 * iFlavorRanged) * 20`
- **Anti-unhappiness modifiers**: Value = `bonus * (2 * iFlavorOffense + iFlavorRanged) / 6`

## Code References

### Military AI Strategy (CvMilitaryAI.cpp)

**Lines 3900-3906: Enough Ranged Units Strategy**
```cpp
bool MilitaryAIHelpers::IsTestStrategy_EnoughRangedUnits(CvPlayer* pPlayer, int iNumRanged, int iNumMelee)
{
    int iFlavorRange = pPlayer->GetGrandStrategyAI()->GetPersonalityAndGrandStrategy((FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_RANGED"));
    int iRatio = iNumRanged * 10 / max(1,iNumMelee+iNumRanged);
    return (iRatio >= iFlavorRange);
}
```

Determines when the player has sufficient ranged units. The ratio calculation converts unit counts to a percentage (0-10 scale), compared against the FLAVOR_RANGED value.

**Lines 3908-3922: Need Ranged Units Strategy**
```cpp
bool MilitaryAIHelpers::IsTestStrategy_NeedRangedUnits(CvPlayer* pPlayer, int iNumRanged, int iNumMelee)
{
    if(pPlayer->GetMilitaryAI()->IsBuildingArmy(ARMY_TYPE_LAND))
    {
        if (pPlayer->IsUnderrepresentedUnitType(UNITAI_RANGED) || pPlayer->IsUnderrepresentedUnitType(UNITAI_CITY_BOMBARD))
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    int iFlavorRange = pPlayer->GetGrandStrategyAI()->GetPersonalityAndGrandStrategy((FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_RANGED"));
    int iRatio = iNumRanged * 10 / max(1,iNumMelee+iNumRanged);
    return (iRatio <= iFlavorRange / 2);
}
```

Triggers when ranged units fall below half the target ratio, or when building an army with underrepresented ranged unit types.

**Lines 3924-3929: Need Ranged for Early Sneak Attack**
```cpp
bool MilitaryAIHelpers::IsTestStrategy_NeedRangedDueToEarlySneakAttack(CvPlayer* pPlayer)
{
    MilitaryAIStrategyTypes eStrategyWarMob = (MilitaryAIStrategyTypes) GC.getInfoTypeForString("MILITARYAISTRATEGY_WAR_MOBILIZATION");
    return pPlayer->GetMilitaryAI()->IsUsingStrategy(eStrategyWarMob);
}
```

Ensures ranged units are produced during war mobilization for sneak attacks.

### Unit Promotion AI (CvUnit.cpp)

**Line 31664: Flavor Initialization**
```cpp
int iFlavorRanged = range(pFlavorMgr->GetPersonalityIndividualFlavor((FlavorTypes)GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_RANGED")), 1, 20);
```

Retrieves the player's FLAVOR_RANGED value, clamped between 1-20, for use in promotion value calculations throughout the AI_PromotionValue function.

The flavor is then used extensively in promotion scoring calculations (see lines 31716, 32055, 32237, 32247, 33099) to weight ranged-focused promotions.

### Technology Research (CvTechClasses.cpp)

**Lines 1250-1269: Conquest Focus Bonus**
```cpp
if(bConquestFocus && (
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_OFFENSE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_MOBILE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_RANGED" ||
    // ... other military flavors
))
{
    m_piGSTechPriority[iTechLoop]++;
}
```

When pursuing conquest grand strategy, technologies with FLAVOR_RANGED receive priority bonuses.

### Policy Selection (CvPolicyAI.cpp)

**Line 4916: Conquest Victory Scoring**
```cpp
if (GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_OFFENSE" || ... ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_RANGED" || ... )
{
    iConquestValue += iFlavorValue;
}
```

Policies with FLAVOR_RANGED contribute to conquest victory scoring, influencing policy tree selection for militaristic AIs.

### Grand Strategy AI (CvGrandStrategyAI.cpp)

**Lines 630-641: Policy Priority Bonuses**
```cpp
else if (GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop) == "FLAVOR_RANGED")
{
    iPriorityBonus += pkPolicyInfo->GetFlavorValue(iFlavorLoop);
}
```

Adds priority bonuses to policies that align with the player's ranged flavor preference.

### Advisor Recommendations (CvAdvisorRecommender.cpp)

**Lines 361-364: Unit Advisor Weighting**
```cpp
else if(strFlavorName == "FLAVOR_RANGED")
{
    return 13;
}
```

The advisor system assigns a weight of 13 to FLAVOR_RANGED when recommending units to the player, indicating high importance in unit selection recommendations.

## Strategic Influences

### Economic Strategies

**Losing Money (-300 to cities, -50 to player)**
When the economy is struggling, FLAVOR_RANGED receives massive penalties to reduce expensive ranged unit production.

**Too Many Units (-100 to player, -300 to cities)**
Reduces ranged unit production when the military is oversized relative to economy.

### Military Strategies

**Eradicate Barbarians Critical (+10)**
Increases ranged preference when barbarians pose a serious threat, as ranged units are effective for defensive operations.

**War Mobilization (+60)**
Major boost when preparing for war, ensuring adequate ranged support for offensive operations.

**At War (+30 player, +40 cities)**
Sustained production of ranged units during active conflicts.

**Winning Wars (+40 player, +60 cities)**
When winning, increases ranged production to press the advantage with superior firepower.

**Losing Wars (+20 player, +30 cities)**
Moderate increase when losing, as ranged units provide defensive advantages.
