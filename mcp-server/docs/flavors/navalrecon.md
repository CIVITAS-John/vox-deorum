# FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON

## Overview

FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON is an AI personality flavor that controls the prioritization of naval exploration, sea scouting, and ocean-based reconnaissance in Civilization V. This flavor influences how aggressively the AI invests in naval units designed for exploration and vision, particularly units that can reveal the fog of war over water tiles and discover new continents.

## Description

Prioritization of naval exploration and sea-based reconnaissance units

## AI Behavior Impact

The FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON flavor affects multiple aspects of AI decision-making across different game systems, with particular emphasis on maritime exploration and ocean control:

### Naval Explorer Calculation

**Dynamic Explorer Requirements**: The FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON value directly modifies how many naval explorers the AI believes it needs. In `CvEconomicAI.cpp`, the calculation determines plots per explorer:

```
iPlotsPerExplorer = MAX_PLOTS_PER_EXPLORER - FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON
```

- **Higher values** (e.g., 8-10): Reduce plots per explorer, requiring more exploration units
- **Lower values** (e.g., 2-4): Increase plots per explorer, requiring fewer exploration units
- **Standard range**: Typically 5-7 for most leaders

This means a leader with FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON = 8 will want roughly 35% more naval explorers than a leader with value = 5.

**Recon State Management**: The AI maintains a naval reconnaissance state that determines exploration priorities:
- `RECON_STATE_NEEDED`: Actively seeking more naval explorers
- `RECON_STATE_NEUTRAL`: Maintaining current exploration capacity
- `RECON_STATE_ENOUGH`: Satisfied with current naval exploration coverage

### Naval Unit Production

**Exploration Ship Prioritization**: Higher FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON values significantly increase the AI's tendency to produce and value naval units with exploration capabilities:

**Early Era Explorers** (Ancient to Medieval):
- Galley (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 7)
- Trireme (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 10)
- Carthaginian Quinquereme (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 15)

**Age of Exploration** (Renaissance to Industrial):
- Caravel (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 24) - Primary exploration vessel
- Portuguese Nau (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 30) - Enhanced exploration unique unit
- Longship (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 27) - Viking exploration vessel
- Privateer (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 26)
- Ironclad (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 28)

**Modern Era Reconnaissance Ships**:
- Destroyer (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 32)
- Fleet Destroyer (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 36)
- Submarine (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 30)
- Nuclear Submarine (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 36)
- Sensor Combat Ship (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 40) - Maximum recon capability
- Supercarrier (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 40) - Air-based naval reconnaissance

### Technology Research Priorities

**Exploration Technologies**: FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON increases research priority for technologies that unlock naval exploration:

- **Compass** (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 20): Unlocks Caravel and Harbor, enables longer sea trade routes
- **Astronomy** (FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON: 20): Enables ocean crossing and observatories, critical for transoceanic exploration

These technologies become significantly more attractive to leaders with high naval recon values.
