# FLAVOR_MOBILE

## Overview

FLAVOR_MOBILE is an AI personality flavor in Civilization V that controls the AI's preference for fast-moving, mobile military units. This flavor significantly influences unit composition, military strategies, promotion choices, and technology/policy preferences related to mobility and maneuverability on the battlefield.

The flavor value is used to determine how much an AI player values cavalry units, tanks, and other fast-moving units over slower infantry and melee units. Higher FLAVOR_MOBILE values result in armies with more mounted units and armor, while lower values lead to more traditional infantry-focused armies.

## Core Functionality

### Military Unit Composition Strategy

FLAVOR_MOBILE is a primary factor in determining whether the AI needs more mobile units or has enough:

**Military AI Strategies** (`CvMilitaryAI.cpp:2070-2073`):
- `MILITARYAISTRATEGY_NEED_MOBILE`: Activated when mobile unit ratio is too low relative to FLAVOR_MOBILE
- `MILITARYAISTRATEGY_ENOUGH_MOBILE`: Activated when mobile unit ratio meets or exceeds FLAVOR_MOBILE threshold

**Mobile Unit Classification** (`CvMilitaryAI.cpp:1697-1698`):
Units are classified as "mobile" if they belong to these combat types:
- `UNITCOMBAT_MOUNTED`: Cavalry, horsemen, lancers, etc.
- `UNITCOMBAT_ARMOR`: Tanks, mechanized infantry, modern armor

### Strategy Evaluation Logic

**IsTestStrategy_EnoughMobileUnits** (`CvMilitaryAI.cpp:3932-3945`):
```
iFlavorMobile = player's FLAVOR_MOBILE value (from personality + grand strategy)

Without MOD_AI_UNIT_PRODUCTION:
  iRatio = (mobile units * 10) / (melee + mobile units)
  Strategy active if: iRatio >= iFlavorMobile

With MOD_AI_UNIT_PRODUCTION:
  iRatio = (mobile units * 10) / melee units
  Strategy active if: iRatio >= iFlavorMobile
```

**IsTestStrategy_NeedMobileUnits** (`CvMilitaryAI.cpp:3948-3961`):
```
iFlavorMobile = player's FLAVOR_MOBILE value

Without MOD_AI_UNIT_PRODUCTION:
  iRatio = (mobile units * 10) / (melee + mobile units)
  Strategy active if: iRatio <= iFlavorMobile / 2

With MOD_AI_UNIT_PRODUCTION:
  iRatio = (mobile units * 10) / melee units
  Strategy active if: iRatio <= iFlavorMobile / 2
```

This means an AI with FLAVOR_MOBILE of 10 will:
- Activate "Need Mobile" if mobile units are less than 5% of the ratio
- Activate "Enough Mobile" if mobile units reach 10% of the ratio

## Unit Promotion Preferences

FLAVOR_MOBILE heavily influences AI promotion choices for units. The flavor value (ranged 1-20) is used as a multiplier in calculating promotion value scores:

## Grand Strategy and Policy

**Conquest Victory Focus** (`CvGrandStrategyAI.cpp:622-625`):
FLAVOR_MOBILE is considered a conquest-oriented military flavor. When evaluating policies for conquest grand strategy, policies with FLAVOR_MOBILE bonuses receive priority increases.

**Policy Valuation** (`CvPolicyAI.cpp:4916`):
FLAVOR_MOBILE is grouped with core military flavors (OFFENSE, DEFENSE, CITY_DEFENSE, MILITARY_TRAINING, RANGED, ARCHER, SIEGE, SKIRMISHER) when calculating the conquest value of policies. This means policies granting mobility bonuses are valued more highly by militaristic AIs.

## Technology Research

**Conquest-Focused Tech Research** (`CvTechClasses.cpp:1254`):
Technologies with FLAVOR_MOBILE bonuses receive increased priority when the AI is pursuing conquest-focused grand strategies. This is grouped with other military flavors (OFFENSE, MILITARY_TRAINING, RANGED, DEFENSE, AIR) to identify military-critical technologies.

Technologies likely to have FLAVOR_MOBILE include:
- Horseback Riding (cavalry)
- Chivalry (knights)
- Military Science (cavalry corps)
- Combustion (tanks)
- Combined Arms (modern armor)
- Mobile Tactics (mechanized infantry)

## Advisor Recommendations

**Flavor Priority Index** (`CvAdvisorRecommender.cpp:365-368`):
FLAVOR_MOBILE has a priority index of 7 in the advisor recommendation system. This moderate-high priority means mobile unit recommendations will be suggested fairly frequently, though less than core flavors like OFFENSE (1) or RANGED (13).

## Impact on AI Behavior

### Army Composition
- **High FLAVOR_MOBILE (8-10)**: Army will be 40-50% cavalry/armor, highly mobile strike forces
- **Medium FLAVOR_MOBILE (4-7)**: Balanced mix of mobile and infantry units (20-35% mobile)
- **Low FLAVOR_MOBILE (1-3)**: Infantry-focused armies with minimal cavalry (5-15% mobile)

### Tactical Implications
- High mobility AIs prefer:
  - Flanking maneuvers and envelopment tactics
  - Hit-and-run raids on enemy territory
  - Rapid redeployment between fronts
  - Pillaging and economic disruption
  - Exploiting open terrain advantages

- Low mobility AIs prefer:
  - Defensive formations and fortified positions
  - Slower, methodical advances
  - City siege warfare
  - Holding strategic positions

### Promotion Patterns
Mobile-focused AIs will heavily favor:
1. Movement speed increases (+1 movement)
2. Withdrawal chance bonuses
3. Ignore ZOC abilities
4. March/Always Heal for sustained operations
5. Flanking attack bonuses
6. Open terrain combat bonuses
7. River crossing abilities

### Technology and Policy Priorities
Mobile-focused AIs will:
- Research cavalry and armor technologies earlier
- Value policies improving unit movement and positioning
- Prioritize upgrades for mounted units
- Focus on doctrines enabling rapid warfare

## Related Flavors

FLAVOR_MOBILE often works in conjunction with:
- **FLAVOR_OFFENSE**: Combined for aggressive mobile warfare (blitzkrieg tactics)
- **FLAVOR_RECON**: Combined for scouting and fast reconnaissance forces
- **FLAVOR_NAVAL_RECON**: Combined for naval exploration and rapid sea control
- **FLAVOR_DEFENSE**: Balanced to determine offensive vs defensive mobile tactics

## Statistical Tracking

The game tracks mobile unit counts separately (`m_iNumMobileLandUnits` in `CvMilitaryAI.h:337`) and includes this data in military CSV logs for analysis and balancing.

## Implementation Notes

- FLAVOR_MOBILE values are typically ranged between 1-20 for calculations
- The flavor is retrieved via: `GC.getInfoTypeForString("FLAVOR_MOBILE")`
- Values are combined from leader personality base flavors and grand strategy modifiers
- The flavor affects hundreds of individual calculations throughout the AI decision-making process
- Mobile units specifically exclude immobile units (DOMAIN_IMMOBILE) and dead units from consideration
