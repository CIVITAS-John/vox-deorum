# FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING

## Overview

`FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING` is an AI personality flavor that controls how much a civilization prioritizes building and maintaining a well-trained, experienced military force. This flavor affects the AI's interest in constructing military training facilities (barracks, armories, military academies), prioritizing unit upgrades, and adopting policies and technologies that enhance unit effectiveness.

Unlike offensive or defensive flavors that focus on unit production or combat strategy, `FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING` specifically emphasizes the **quality and readiness** of military forces through infrastructure investment and unit experience systems.

### Value Range

### 1. Military Advisor Recommendation Priority (CvAdvisorRecommender.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvAdvisorRecommender.cpp` (line 353-356)

**Function:** Advisor recommendation weight calculation

When the Military Advisor evaluates recommendations (buildings, units, technologies), FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING contributes to the priority weighting.

```cpp
else if(strFlavorName == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING")
{
    return 7;
}
```

**Interpretation:** FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING receives a weight of 7 out of the various military flavors considered by the advisor system. This places it at moderate-high importance for military recommendations, equal to FLAVOR_MOBILE and below FLAVOR_OFFENSE (17) and FLAVOR_DEFENSE (16).

**Impact:** Buildings and technologies with FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING values will be recommended by the Military Advisor with moderate-high priority, encouraging the player to invest in military training infrastructure.

### 2. Conquest Grand Strategy Policy Evaluation (CvGrandStrategyAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvGrandStrategyAI.cpp` (lines 626-629)

**Function:** `CvGrandStrategyAI::GetConquestPriority()` - Policy priority bonus for conquest strategy

When evaluating which policies to pursue while following a Conquest grand strategy, the AI adds priority bonuses based on military-related flavors.

```cpp
else if (GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop) == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING")
{
    iPriorityBonus += pkPolicyInfo->GetFlavorValue(iFlavorLoop);
}
```

**Interpretation:** Policies with FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING values (such as Honor opener, Military Tradition, Elite Forces) receive priority bonuses when the AI is pursuing conquest victory. Each point of FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING in the policy adds directly to its priority score.

**Impact:** Leaders with high FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING will more strongly favor military training-focused policies when pursuing conquest, creating synergy between personality, grand strategy, and policy choices.

### 3. Conquest Grand Strategy Building Evaluation (CvGrandStrategyAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvGrandStrategyAI.cpp` (lines 711-714)

**Function:** `CvGrandStrategyAI::GetConquestPriority()` - Building priority bonus for conquest strategy

When calculating conquest priority, the AI examines existing buildings in all cities and adds bonuses based on their military training values.

```cpp
else if (GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop) == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING")
{
    iPriorityBonus += pkLoopBuilding->GetFlavorValue(iFlavorLoop);
}
```

**Interpretation:** Each building with FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING (barracks, armories, military academies, etc.) in the player's empire increases the priority of the Conquest grand strategy. The AI recognizes that existing military infrastructure makes conquest more viable.

**Impact:** As players build more training facilities, the AI becomes more confident in pursuing conquest, creating a positive feedback loop where military infrastructure investment reinforces aggressive grand strategy.

### 4. Unit Upgrade Gold Priority (CvHomelandAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvHomelandAI.cpp` (lines 1862-1872)

**Function:** `CvHomelandAI::ExecuteUpgradeMoves()` - Unit upgrade financial priority calculation

When units need upgrading but lack sufficient gold, the AI determines how much to prioritize saving gold for upgrades.

```cpp
if(GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop) == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING")
{
    iCurrentFlavorMilitaryTraining = m_pPlayer->GetFlavorManager()->GetPersonalityIndividualFlavor((FlavorTypes)iFlavorLoop);
}
if(m_pPlayer->IsAtWar())
{
    iCurrentFlavorMilitaryTraining *= 50;
}
```

**Gold Priority Calculation:**
```cpp
iGoldPriority = AI_GOLD_PRIORITY_UPGRADE_BASE + (iCurrentFlavorMilitaryTraining * AI_GOLD_PRIORITY_UPGRADE_PER_FLAVOR_POINT);
```

**Interpretation:**
- Base gold priority for upgrades: 500
- Each point of FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING adds 100 to the priority
- **During wartime, FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING is multiplied by 50**, making upgrades extremely high priority
- Example: Leader with FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING = 8 at peace → priority = 500 + (8 × 100) = 1300
- Example: Same leader at war → priority = 500 + (400 × 100) = 40,500 (critical priority)

**Impact:** Leaders with high FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING will aggressively save gold for unit upgrades, especially during warfare. This ensures their military remains technologically competitive. The dramatic multiplier during war means these leaders will sacrifice economic development to maintain cutting-edge military forces.

### 5. Policy Victory Strategy Categorization (CvPolicyAI.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvPolicyAI.cpp` (line 4916-4919)

**Function:** `CvPolicyAI::WeighPolicy()` - Policy flavor to victory condition mapping

When evaluating policies, the AI categorizes flavor types to determine which victory conditions the policy supports.

```cpp
if (GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_OFFENSE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_DEFENSE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_CITY_DEFENSE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_MOBILE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_RANGED" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_ARCHER" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_SIEGE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_SKIRMISHER")
{
    iConquestValue += iFlavorValue;
}
```

**Interpretation:** FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING is classified as a conquest-supporting flavor. Policies with this flavor contribute to the policy's perceived value for pursuing domination victory.

**Impact:** Leaders with high personal FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING values will rate military training policies as more valuable, creating alignment between personality and grand strategy preferences. This reinforces conquest-oriented policy trees like Honor and Autocracy.

### 6. Technology Priority for Conquest Victory (CvTechClasses.cpp)

**Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvTechClasses.cpp` (lines 1253)

**Function:** Grand Strategy technology prioritization

When the AI is focusing on conquest victory, it evaluates technologies and increases priority for those with military-related flavors.

```cpp
if(bConquestFocus && (
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_OFFENSE" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING" ||
    GC.getFlavorTypes((FlavorTypes)iFlavor) == "FLAVOR_MOBILE" ||
    // ... other military flavors
    ))
{
    m_piGSTechPriority[iTechLoop]++;

## Design Philosophy

FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING represents the distinction between:
1. **Quantity:** Raw military unit production (controlled by FLAVOR_OFFENSE, FLAVOR_DEFENSE)
2. **Quality:** Unit experience, training infrastructure, and technological modernity (controlled by FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING)
3. **Strategy:** Unit composition and tactical deployment (controlled by specialized flavors)

This allows for differentiated military AI personalities:
- **High TRAINING, High OFFENSE:** Elite aggressive military (Genghis Khan, Shaka)
- **High TRAINING, Low OFFENSE:** Professional defensive military (Bismarck)
- **Low TRAINING, High OFFENSE:** Quantity-over-quality approach (Barbarian hordes)
- **Moderate TRAINING, Balanced:** Flexible mixed-quality forces (Diplomatic leaders)

The flavor especially influences the AI's economic trade-offs during war. High FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING leaders will sacrifice immediate economic growth to maintain cutting-edge military forces through upgrades, while low-training leaders may rely on numerical superiority with cheaper, obsolete units.

## Related Flavors

- **FLAVOR_OFFENSE:** General aggressive military behavior and unit production
- **FLAVOR_DEFENSE:** Defensive unit production and city defense priorities
- **FLAVOR_CITY_DEFENSE:** Specific focus on garrisoning and defending cities
- **FLAVOR_MOBILE:** Cavalry and mobile unit preferences
- **FLAVOR_RANGED:** Archer and ranged unit preferences
- **FLAVOR_EXPANSION:** Territory acquisition (affects military needs)
- **FLAVOR_PRODUCTION:** General production emphasis (affects building speed)

FLAVOR_MILITARY_TRAINING typically has higher values for conquest-oriented leaders and those with military training unique buildings (Zulu Ikanda, Japanese Dojo, Austrian Schützenstand). It acts as a force multiplier for other military flavors by ensuring units are well-trained and technologically current.
