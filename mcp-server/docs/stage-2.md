# Stage 2: Bridge Service Integration âœ…

## Overview
Integration with the Bridge Service for game communication via HTTP REST and Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## What Was Actually Implemented

### 1. BridgeManager (`src/bridge/bridge-manager.ts`)
Central manager for all Bridge Service communication:
- **Health Checking**: `checkHealth()` monitors Bridge Service and DLL connection status
- **Lua Script Execution**: `executeLuaScript()` sends raw Lua code for execution
- **Lua Function Calls**: `callLuaFunction()` invokes named functions with arguments
- **SSE Connection**: Event stream connection with automatic reconnection
- **Event Emitter**: Extends EventEmitter for connection status and game events
- **Function Registry**: Tracks LuaFunction instances (though not fully utilized)

### 2. LuaFunction Class (`src/bridge/lua-function.ts`)
Encapsulates Lua function definitions:
- Function name and implementation script storage
- Registration state tracking
- Lazy registration pattern (prepared but not fully implemented)
- Reset capability for new game sessions

### 3. Integration Points
- **Server Initialization**: BridgeManager created during MCPServer construction
- **Singleton Access**: Exported `bridgeManager` instance from server.ts
- **SSE Auto-Connect**: Connects to event stream during server initialization
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with structured error objects

### 4. Protocol Implementation
Following PROTOCOL.md specifications:
- **REST Endpoints**: `/health`, `/lua/execute`, `/lua/call`
- **SSE Stream**: `/events` endpoint for real-time updates
- **Response Format**: Standardized success/error response structure
- **Event Processing**: GameEvent interface for typed events

## What Was NOT Implemented
- Lazy registration of Lua functions (structure exists but not used)
- Automatic re-registration on errors
- Timeout mechanisms for hanging requests
- Complex retry logic beyond SSE reconnection
- Full utilization of LuaFunction registry

## Key Components

### Response Interfaces
```typescript
interface LuaResponse {
  success: boolean;
  result?: any;
  error?: { code: string; message: string; details?: string; };
}

interface HealthResponse {
  success: boolean;
  dll_connected: boolean;
  uptime: number;
  version: string;
}

interface GameEvent {
  type: string;
  payload: any;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### Event System
- `connected`: SSE stream established
- `disconnected`: SSE stream lost
- `gameEvent`: Game event received

## Usage Example
```typescript
// Access via singleton
import { bridgeManager } from './server.js';

// Check health
const health = await bridgeManager.checkHealth();

// Execute Lua script
const response = await bridgeManager.executeLuaScript('return Game.GetPlayer(0)');

// Call Lua function
const result = await bridgeManager.callLuaFunction('GetPlayerInfo', [0]);
```
