# Stage 2: Bridge Service Integration Manager

## Overview
Create a manager component that handles all communication with the Bridge Service, abstracting the complexity of HTTP REST and SSE interactions while providing clean, stateless APIs for the MCP Server.

## Goals
- Establish reliable communication with the Bridge Service
- Abstract protocol details from higher-level MCP operations
- Support dynamic Lua function registration and execution
- Handle connection failures gracefully
- Maintain clean separation between MCP and Bridge protocols

## Components

### BridgeManager
The central manager object that coordinates all Bridge Service interactions:
- **Connection Management**: Establish and maintain HTTP/SSE connections
- **Lua Script Execution**: Send raw Lua scripts for execution in the game
- **Function Registry**: Track registered Lua functions to avoid redundant registrations
- **Error Recovery**: Handle connection failures and automatic retry logic
- **State Reset**: Support clean resets when game sessions change

### LuaFunction Class
Encapsulates individual Lua functions with lazy registration:
- **Definition**: Store function name and implementation script
- **Registration State**: Track whether function is registered with Bridge
- **Execution**: Handle registration-on-demand and automatic retry on registration errors
- **Error Handling**: Detect registration failures and attempt recovery

## Implementation Flow

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
1. Create BridgeManager class with HTTP client setup
2. Implement connection health checking
3. Add configuration for Bridge Service endpoints
4. Set up logging for communication debugging

### Phase 2: Lua Script Execution
1. Implement raw Lua script execution endpoint
2. Add response parsing and error handling
3. Create timeout mechanisms for hanging requests
4. Build retry logic for transient failures

### Phase 3: Function Registration System
1. Create LuaFunction class with constructor and properties
2. Implement lazy registration on first execution
3. Add automatic re-registration on specific errors
4. Build registry tracking in BridgeManager

### Phase 4: State Management
1. Implement reset functionality for all registered functions
2. Add connection state monitoring
3. Create event emitters for connection status changes
4. Build recovery mechanisms for lost connections

## Success Criteria
- Can execute arbitrary Lua scripts through Bridge Service
- Functions register automatically when first called
- Failed registrations retry automatically
- Connection failures handled gracefully
- Can reset all state for new game sessions
- All interactions follow PROTOCOL.md specifications

## Dependencies
- Stage 1 (Core MCP Infrastructure) must be complete
- Bridge Service must be running and accessible
- HTTP client libraries configured and tested

## Next Steps
Stage 3 will build upon this foundation to process real-time game events from the SSE stream, enabling the MCP Server to maintain up-to-date game state knowledge.
