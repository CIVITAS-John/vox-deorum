# Overview

The `ReligionEnhanced` event is triggered when a player successfully enhances their founded religion by adding enhancer beliefs. Religion enhancement is the second major step in religious development, occurring after founding a religion, and provides additional powerful beliefs that significantly strengthen the religion's capabilities and spread.

# Event Triggers

This event is triggered in the following scenarios:

- When a player spends Faith to enhance their founded religion with enhancer beliefs
- Upon successful selection and addition of enhancer beliefs to an existing religion
- After the enhancer beliefs have been integrated into the religion and applied to all cities
- During the religion enhancement process via Great Prophets or Faith expenditure
- Only for players who have previously founded a religion that is eligible for enhancement

# Event Details

Religion enhancement represents a major milestone in religious development, transforming a basic founded religion into a more powerful and competitive faith. The enhancement process involves:

- **Enhancer Beliefs:** Adding two powerful beliefs that provide significant bonuses
- **Religious Strength:** Enhanced religions become more effective at spreading and competing
- **Strategic Depth:** Enhancer beliefs often provide unique strategic advantages
- **Faith Investment:** Significant Faith cost represents a major resource commitment

Key aspects of religion enhancement:
- Only available to civilizations that have already founded a religion
- Requires substantial Faith expenditure, typically through Great Prophets
- Each enhancer belief can only be chosen once per game across all religions
- Enhanced religions gain significant competitive advantages in religious conflict
- The enhancement is permanent and affects all cities following the religion

Benefits of religion enhancement include:
- More effective religious spread and pressure
- Unique gameplay bonuses based on chosen enhancer beliefs
- Increased competitiveness against other religions
- Access to advanced religious strategies and victory paths

This event is critical for AI systems because:
- It signals a major increase in a civilization's religious power
- It indicates substantial Faith investment and religious commitment
- It affects religious competition dynamics across the game
- It enables prediction of future religious strategies and capabilities
