# Overview

The `PlayerBoughtOut` event is triggered when a major civilization successfully buys out a city-state (minor civilization), effectively removing the city-state from independent status. This event captures a significant diplomatic and economic action that eliminates a minor civilization from the game.

# Event Triggers

This event is triggered when a major civilization completes the buyout process of a minor civilization through the city-state interaction system. The trigger occurs within the `CvMinorCivAI` class when the buyout transaction is finalized and the minor civilization transitions from independent status to being controlled by the purchasing major civilization.

The buyout typically requires:
1. **Diplomatic Prerequisites**: Specific relationship levels or conditions with the city-state
2. **Economic Investment**: Substantial gold or resource expenditure
3. **Strategic Opportunity**: Appropriate game state conditions for buyout availability

The event passes two parameters to event handlers:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
