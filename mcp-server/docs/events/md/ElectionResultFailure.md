# Overview

The ElectionResultFailure event is triggered when a spy's attempt to rig elections in a minor civilization fails. This espionage-related event captures unsuccessful election interference operations, allowing AI systems to track failed covert activities and adjust espionage strategies accordingly.

# Event Triggers

This event is fired in the `CvMinorCivAI.cpp` file when a spy fails in their attempt to rig elections in a minor civilization's capital. The event occurs during the minor civilization's election processing phase and represents a failed espionage operation.

**Trigger Location:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvMinorCivAI.cpp:17336`

**Trigger Condition:** When a spy fails to successfully rig elections in a minor civilization

# Parameters

The ElectionResultFailure event passes the following parameters:

1. **Player ID** (`(int)ePlayer`) - The unique identifier of the player whose spy attempted the election rigging
2. **Spy ID** (`iSpyID`) - The unique identifier of the spy that failed the operation
3. **Diminish Amount** (`iDiminishAmount`) - The amount by which the player's influence with the minor civilization is reduced due to the failure
4. **Capital X Coordinate** (`pCapital->getX()`) - The X coordinate of the minor civilization's capital city where the operation failed
5. **Capital Y Coordinate** (`pCapital->getY()`) - The Y coordinate of the minor civilization's capital city where the operation failed

# Event Details

The ElectionResultFailure event occurs when a spy's covert election interference operation in a minor civilization is unsuccessful. This event provides critical information for AI systems to:

- Track failed espionage operations and their consequences
- Monitor spy performance and operational outcomes
- Adjust diplomatic relations based on failed covert activities
- Update espionage strategies based on operational failures
- Account for influence losses with minor civilizations

The event includes location data to help systems identify which minor civilization was targeted and where the failed operation took place.

# Technical Details

**Event Name:** `ElectionResultFailure`
**Hook Type:** Game event invoke hook
**Parameters Count:** 5
**Parameter Types:**
- Player ID (integer)
- Spy ID (integer) 
- Diminish Amount (integer)
- X Coordinate (integer)
- Y Coordinate (integer)

**Source File:** `CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CvMinorCivAI.cpp`
**Line Number:** 17336
**Implementation:** `GAMEEVENTINVOKE_HOOK(GAMEEVENT_ElectionResultFailure, (int)ePlayer, iSpyID, iDiminishAmount, pCapital->getX(), pCapital->getY());`

The event is part of the espionage system's feedback mechanism, allowing external systems to monitor and respond to the outcomes of covert operations in minor civilizations.
