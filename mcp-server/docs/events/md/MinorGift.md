# Overview

The MinorGift event is triggered when a city-state gives a first contact gift to a major civilization. This event captures the various types of gifts that city-states provide when major civilizations first encounter them, including gold, culture, faith, food, and experience bonuses.

# Event Triggers

This event is fired from `CvMinorCivAI::DoFirstContactWithMajor()` when:
- A major civilization makes first contact with a city-state
- The game options `MOD_GLOBAL_CS_GIFTS` and `MOD_EVENTS_MINORS_GIFTS` are both enabled  
- The city-state provides any form of gift during first contact
- The gift calculation and distribution logic completes successfully

This is a one-time event per major civilization per city-state, occurring only on initial diplomatic contact.

# Parameters

The event provides eight parameters with mixed types (`"iiiiibbs"` signature):

1. **Minor Civ Player ID** (`GetPlayer()->GetID()`): The city-state providing the gift
2. **Major Civ Player ID** (`ePlayer`): The major civilization receiving the gift
3. **Gift Value** (`iGift`): The primary gift value (varies by city-state type)
4. **Friendship Boost** (`iFriendshipBoost`): The friendship/influence bonus received
5. **Reserved** (`0`): Currently unused parameter (always 0)
6. **Is First Major Civ** (`bFirstMajorCiv`): Boolean indicating if this is the first major civ to meet this city-state
7. **Reserved** (`false`): Currently unused boolean parameter (always false)
8. **Text Key Suffix** (`szTxtKeySuffix`): String identifier for the gift type/notification text

# Event Details

The gift system varies by city-state type and personality:

**Gift Types by City-State Trait:**
- **Cultured**: Provides culture points and general gifts (iGift = gold + culture + faith)
- **Maritime**: Provides food to cities and general gifts (iGift = general gifts + food)
- **Militaristic**: Provides unit experience and gift value represents unit type

**Personality Modifiers:**
- **Friendly**: 1.5x multiplier on most gifts, 2x unit gifts
- **Hostile**: 0.5x multiplier on most gifts, 0x unit gifts  
- **Neutral/Irrational**: Standard gift amounts

**Special Mechanics:**
- First major civilization to meet the city-state receives enhanced bonuses
- Food gifts target the closest city to the city-state (or capital if pre-Medieval era)
- Unit experience bonuses scale with player's current era
- Maritime food gifts only apply if the major civilization has a capital city
