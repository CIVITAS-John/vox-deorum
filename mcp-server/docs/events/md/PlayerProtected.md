# Overview

The PlayerProtected event is triggered when a major civilization pledges to protect a minor civilization (city-state). This event captures the diplomatic relationship change when a major power commits to defending a city-state from potential threats and aggression.

# Event Triggers

This event is triggered when:
- A major civilization successfully pledges protection to a minor civilization
- The major civilization can legally provide protection (passes `CanMajorProtect` validation)
- The MOD_EVENTS_MINORS_INTERACTION mod setting is enabled
- The protection pledge is being established (not revoked)

The event fires immediately after the protection pledge is recorded and timestamped.

# Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `eMajor` | PlayerID | The player ID of the major civilization pledging protection |
| `GetPlayer()->GetID()` | PlayerID | The player ID of the minor civilization being protected |

# Event Details

The PlayerProtected event represents a significant diplomatic action in the relationship between major and minor civilizations. When a major civilization pledges protection to a city-state, it establishes a formal commitment to defend that city-state against aggression from other players.

This protection pledge has several implications:
- Creates a diplomatic obligation for the major civilization
- May influence other players' decisions to attack the protected city-state
- Affects the relationship dynamics between the major and minor civilizations
- Can impact diplomatic standings with other major civilizations

The event provides the essential information needed to track these protection relationships: the identity of both the protector (major civilization) and the protected (minor civilization).
