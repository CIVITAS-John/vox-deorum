# Overview

The ResolutionResult event is triggered when a World Congress or League resolution voting concludes, providing details about the resolution outcome. This event captures both enactment and repeal results for all types of World Congress proposals, including diplomatic victory votes, trade embargoes, city-state protection, and other international legislation.

# Event Triggers

This event is fired from `CvLeague::NotifyProposalResult()` when:
- World Congress/League voting session concludes
- Resolution results are being processed and notifications sent  
- The game option `MOD_EVENTS_RESOLUTIONS` is enabled
- Called for both enact proposals and repeal proposals separately

The event fires during the `NotifySessionDone()` processing, which occurs after all voting is complete but before the proposal lists are cleared.

# Parameters

The event provides five parameters with mixed types (`"iiibb"` signature):

1. **Resolution Type** (`pProposal->GetType()`): The type identifier of the resolution being voted on
2. **Proposer Player ID** (`pProposal->GetProposalPlayer()`): The player who proposed the resolution
3. **Decision/Choice** (`iDecision` or `GetProposerDecision()->GetDecision()`): The specific choice or target of the resolution
4. **Is Enact** (boolean): `true` for enact proposals, `false` for repeal proposals
5. **Passed** (`pProposal->IsPassed()`): Boolean indicating whether the resolution passed or failed
