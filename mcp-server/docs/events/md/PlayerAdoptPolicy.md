# Overview

The `PlayerAdoptPolicy` event is triggered when a player adopts a new policy through the social policy system. This event captures policy adoption regardless of whether it was adopted for free or through spending culture points, providing insights into a player's strategic choices and civilization development.

# Event Triggers

This event is triggered when a player successfully adopts a policy via the `CvPlayer::setHasPolicy()` method. The trigger occurs after all policy-related calculations and effects have been applied, including:

1. **Culture Point Expenditure**: When a player spends accumulated culture to unlock a new policy
2. **Free Policy Grants**: When policies are granted through special circumstances (wonders, events, etc.)
3. **Policy System Updates**: After all yield recalculations and city citizen assignments are complete

The event is fired from within the `CvPlayer` class after policy adoption is finalized.

# Parameters

The event passes two parameters to event handlers:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| PlayerID | PlayerTypes | The ID of the player who adopted the policy |
| PolicyType | PolicyTypes | The type of policy that was adopted |

# Event Details

The event provides essential information about policy adoption:

- **Player Context**: The player ID identifies which civilization made the policy choice
- **Policy Information**: The policy type parameter specifies exactly which policy was adopted
- **Timing**: The event fires after all policy effects have been applied to the game state
- **System Integration**: Triggers after yield updates and citizen reassignments are complete

The event occurs within the social policy system after the player has successfully acquired a new policy, ensuring that all related game mechanics have been processed when event handlers execute.
