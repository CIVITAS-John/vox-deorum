# Overview

The `CityConvertsReligion` event is triggered when a city undergoes religious changes, either through a change in religious majority or a change in follower counts. This event captures religious activity within cities and provides information about the current dominant religion.

# Event Triggers

This event is triggered in two scenarios:

1. **Religious Majority Change**: When a city's religious composition shifts such that a different religion becomes the majority faith
2. **Religious Follower Count Change**: When the number of followers in a city changes, even if the majority religion remains the same

The trigger occurs within the religious follower change processing system in the Community Patch DLL, specifically when either the majority religion changes OR the follower count changes.

# Parameters

The event passes four parameters to event handlers:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Owner | PlayerTypes | The ID of the player who owns the city |
| Religion | ReligionTypes | The type of religion that has become the new majority |
| X | int | The X coordinate of the city on the game map |
| Y | int | The Y coordinate of the city on the game map |

# Event Details

The event provides comprehensive information about religious conversions:

- **New Majority Religion**: The religion parameter identifies which faith has gained dominance in the city
- **City Location**: The X and Y coordinates allow precise identification of the affected city's position
- **Ownership Context**: The owner parameter identifies which player's city has undergone the religious conversion
- **Conversion Significance**: The event triggers for both majority religion changes and any changes in religious follower counts, capturing all forms of religious activity in the city

The event occurs after the city's religious state has been fully updated to reflect the new majority religion, ensuring accurate game state when handlers execute.
