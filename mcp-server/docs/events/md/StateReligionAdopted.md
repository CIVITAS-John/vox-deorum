# Overview

The `StateReligionAdopted` event is triggered when a player adopts their first state religion, transitioning from having no official state religion to establishing one. This represents a major religious and governmental decision that affects the entire civilization through official religious endorsement and associated bonuses.

# Event Triggers

This event is triggered in the following scenarios:

- When a player establishes their first state religion via `SetStateReligion()`
- Upon official governmental adoption of a religion as the state faith
- When transitioning from having no state religion (`NO_RELIGION`) to adopting a specific religion
- During political or religious events that establish official religious endorsement
- Does NOT trigger when changing from one state religion to another (different event exists for that)

# Parameters

The event passes the following parameters:

1. **Player ID** (`m_pPlayer->GetID()`) - The unique identifier of the player adopting the state religion
2. **New State Religion** (`eNewStateReligion`) - The religion being adopted as the official state faith
3. **Previous State Religion** (`GetStateReligion()`) - The previous state religion (should be `NO_RELIGION` for this event)

# Event Details

State religion adoption represents the formal governmental endorsement of a particular faith, creating an official relationship between the state and religion. This decision has significant implications:

- **Official Recognition:** The state formally recognizes and endorses a specific religion

- **Diplomatic Implications:** Affects relationships with civilizations of different faiths

Key aspects of state religion adoption:
- Only fires when transitioning from no state religion to having one
- Represents a one-time governmental decision with lasting consequences
- Often provides significant bonuses that justify the religious commitment
- May be tied to specific government types or policy choices

Strategic considerations for state religion adoption:
- **Timing:** When to make the commitment versus maintaining religious flexibility
- **Selection:** Choosing the most beneficial religion based on beliefs and spread
- **Diplomatic Impact:** How the choice affects relationships with other civilizations
- **Long-term Benefits:** Weighing immediate bonuses against future opportunities

Common effects of state religion adoption include:
- Bonuses to specific yields or game mechanics
- Enhanced religious pressure and unity within the empire
- Improved relationships with civilizations sharing the same faith
- Access to unique governmental or religious mechanics

This event is important for AI systems because:
- It signals a major religious and political commitment
- It indicates the civilization's religious strategic direction
- It affects diplomatic calculations and relationship predictions
- It enables understanding of religious unity and stability factors
- It marks a significant shift in the civilization's identity
