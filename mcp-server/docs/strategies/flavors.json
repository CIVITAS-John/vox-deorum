{
  "Offense": "Accepts higher unit casualties to achieve objectives (1 unit/turn at 6+) and fights with wounded units down to 30 HP instead of withdrawing",
  "Defense": "Prefers fortified positions, uses defensive terrain (hills, forests, rivers), creates defensive lines, stations more units along borders, and maintains larger city garrisons",
  "CityDefense": "Prioritizes unit promotions for static defense (friendly territory bonuses, capital defense, garrisoned attacks) and maintains stronger city garrisons over mobile field armies",
  "MilitaryTraining": "Saves gold for unit upgrades (50x priority during war) to maintain technologically current forces rather than relying on obsolete units",
  "Recon": "Maintains more explorer units (reduces plots-per-explorer threshold by flavor value), produces scouts earlier, and converts combat units to exploration roles",
  "Ranged": "Prioritizes range-extending promotions (3x weight), indirect fire abilities (2x weight), fortification attack bonuses, and targets 10% ranged unit composition per flavor point",
  "Mobile": "Favors flanking maneuvers, hit-and-run raids, rapid redeployment between fronts, pillaging operations, and promotions enabling movement after attacking and withdrawal bonuses",
  "Nuke": "Maintains target arsenal of (flavor / 3) nuclear weapons with +100 production priority when below threshold",
  "UseNuke": "Creates (flavor × 10%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met",
  "Naval": "Allocates naval force percentage using (Coastal Cities / Total Cities) × flavor × 7 and prioritizes combat-effective naval promotions",
  "NavalRecon": "Produces more naval exploration units, assigns ships to reconnaissance missions, prioritizes sight range and movement promotions, and increases scouting during war (+20 to +30)",
  "NavalGrowth": "Prioritizes building Lighthouses and Harbors in coastal cities with 30-35%+ ocean tiles (economic infrastructure, not tactical)",
  "NavalTileImprovement": "Immediately builds work boats when unimproved water resources detected (+150 priority boost), increases during war (+10) for immediate food/production",
  "Air": "Targets air unit percentage equal to flavor value (e.g., 7 = 7% air units) and prioritizes air-specific promotions (range, evasion, air sweep)",
  "AirCarrier": "Increases carrier production priority (Carrier=40, Supercarrier=60) and triggers NEED_AIR_CARRIER strategy when aircraft lack carrier capacity",
  "AntiAir": "Maintains 1 AA unit per 2 melee units when enemy air detected, activates NEED_ANTIAIR strategy (+50 boost) when ratio falls below threshold",
  "Airlift": "High values (6-7) maintain centralized strategic reserves with rapid airlift to threatened cities; low values (4-5) maintain forward-deployed garrisons with minimal redeployment",
  "Expansion": "Wartime heavily penalizes expansion (-100 when losing, -15 during mobilization, -10 at war), forcing resources toward military units instead of settlers",
  "Growth": "Wartime reduces flavor by 10-30 points, deprioritizing food tiles for production tiles and suspending growth infrastructure for military production",
  "TileImprovement": "Increases worker bullying from city-states (up to 90% at flavor 9) and reduces barbarian eradication priority (-15 weight), favoring peaceful development",
  "Infrastructure": "Prioritizes road building and city connections, but wartime reduces flavor by 10-40 points, deprioritizing infrastructure for military concerns",
  "Production": "Workers prioritize mines/lumber mills over farms (× flavor × 2), cities work more hill tiles, wartime increases flavor by 10-20 for faster unit production",
  "WaterConnection": "Prioritizes harbor construction in coastal cities for trade routes (economic infrastructure, not tactical)",
  "Gold": "May purchase military units for immediate deployment during warfare rather than building them, enabling rapid reinforcement",
  "Science": "Advances faster through tech tree to unlock superior military units and defenses earlier (strategic advantage, not tactical behavior change)",
  "Culture": "Does not impact tactical AI decisions - only affects strategic choices like victory pursuit and city specialization",
  "Happiness": "Does not directly impact tactical decisions - affects building priorities and economic choices, with wartime modifiers (-5 at war, +20 winning, -10 losing)",
  "GreatPeople": "Does not impact tactical decisions - influences infrastructure choices for specialist buildings and GPP generation",
  "Wonder": "Halves wonder production during defensive crises and reduces by 20-50 points at war, ensuring military survival takes priority over monument building",
  "Religion": "Does not impact tactical decisions - only affects strategic planning, religious strategy, and diplomatic behavior",
  "Diplomacy": "Does not impact tactical combat - controls diplomatic unit production and city-state investment, heavily penalized during warfare (-25 to -50)",
  "Spaceship": "Does not impact tactical decisions - exclusively governs strategic late-game science victory choices",
  "Espionage": "High values (8-10) build counterintelligence in top 50% science cities; low values (0-3) protect only top 15% (strategic infrastructure, not tactical)"
