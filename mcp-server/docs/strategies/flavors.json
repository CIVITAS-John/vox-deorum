{
  "Offense": "Pivots the military towards offensive stances. Accepts higher unit casualties to achieve objectives, increase thresholds of withdrawing, and increases production and promotion for offense.",
  "Defense": "Pivots the military towards defensive stances. Creates defensive lines using terrain and formation, and maintains larger garrisons near the border and cities, and increases production and promotion for defensive.",
  "UseNuke": "Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met.",
  "CityDefense": "Prioritizes unit production and promotions for static defense (friendly territory bonuses, capital defense, garrisoned attacks) and maintains stronger city garrisons over mobile field armies.",
  "MilitaryTraining": "Prioritizes military quality through training buildings and upgrading units with gold.",

  "Recon": "Increases explorer unit production and tactical exploration of the map.",
  "Ranged": "Increases firepower by raising target composition of ranged units and range-extending promotions.",
  "Mobile": "Increases mobility and maneuverability by raising target composition of mobile units and prioritizes related promotions.",
  "Nuke": "Increases nuclear weapon arsenals for strategic deterrence.",
  "Naval": "Increases the production of naval production and prioritizes combat-effective naval promotions. Naval size is also based on coastal city percentage and geography.",
  "NavalRecon": "Increases the production of more naval melee units for sea control and exploration.",
  "Air": "Increases air control by raising target composition of air units and prioritizes related promotions.",

  "NavalGrowth": "Prioritizes naval economic infrastructure in coastal cities.",
  "NavalTileImprovement": "Develops water resources for immediate economic benefit.",
  
  "AirCarrier": "Increases carrier production to support air operations. Triggers carrier production when aircraft lack sufficient capacity",
  "AntiAir": "Maintains anti-air unit ratio to counter enemy aircraft. Activates anti-air strategy when enemy air detected and ratio falls below threshold",
  "Airlift": "Influences troop deployment strategy through airlift infrastructure. High values favor centralized reserves with rapid deployment; low values favor forward garrisons",
  "Expansion": "Balances expansion with military priorities during wartime. Wartime heavily penalizes expansion, forcing resources toward military units",
  "Growth": "Balances population growth with military production needs. Wartime reduces flavor, deprioritizing food tiles and growth infrastructure for military production",
  "TileImprovement": "Emphasizes peaceful economic development over military concerns. Increases worker bullying from city-states and reduces barbarian eradication priority",
  "Infrastructure": "Prioritizes road building and city connections for economic efficiency. Wartime reduces flavor, deprioritizing infrastructure for military concerns",
  "Production": "Emphasizes production output over other yields. Workers prioritize mines and lumber mills, cities work hill tiles, wartime increases flavor for faster unit production",
  "WaterConnection": "Prioritizes harbor construction for trade route connectivity. Economic infrastructure focus, not tactical",
  "Gold": "Influences gold spending priorities during warfare. May purchase military units for immediate deployment rather than building them",
  "Science": "Advances through tech tree for superior military units. Strategic advantage through earlier access to advanced technologies, not tactical behavior change",
  "Culture": "Does not impact tactical AI decisions. Only affects strategic choices like victory pursuit and city specialization",
  "Happiness": "Does not directly impact tactical decisions. Affects building priorities and economic choices with wartime modifiers",
  "GreatPeople": "Does not impact tactical decisions. Influences infrastructure choices for specialist buildings and great person generation",
  "Wonder": "Balances wonder construction with military survival priorities. Reduces wonder production during defensive crises and wartime",
  "Religion": "Does not impact tactical decisions. Only affects strategic planning, religious strategy, and diplomatic behavior",
  "Diplomacy": "Does not impact tactical combat. Controls diplomatic unit production and city-state investment, heavily penalized during warfare",
  "Spaceship": "Does not impact tactical decisions. Exclusively governs strategic late-game science victory choices",
  "Espionage": "Prioritizes counterintelligence in high-value science cities. High values protect top 50% science cities; low values protect only top 15%"
