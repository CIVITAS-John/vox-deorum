# Stage 1: Core MCP Infrastructure ✅

## Overview
Build a functional MCP server using the TypeScript SDK. Create a thin wrapper that adds logging, configuration, and prepares for Bridge Service integration.

## Objectives (Completed)
1. ✅ Working MCP server with SDK's built-in Server class
2. ✅ Support stdio and HTTP transports 
3. ✅ Placeholder resources and tools with base classes
4. ✅ Extension points for Bridge Service integration

## Implementation (Completed)

### 1. Main Server (`src/server.ts`) ✅
- Uses SDK's built-in Server class
- Maintains registries for resources and tools
- Provides registration methods for self-registering components
- Sets up capabilities based on registered handlers
- Singleton pattern with getServer() accessor

### 2. Multi-Transport Support ✅
- **Stdio Transport** (`src/stdio.ts`): Default mode for direct client connections
- **HTTP Transport** (`src/http.ts`): Express server with Streamable HTTP support and CORS
- **Entry Point** (`src/index.ts`): Reads config from `src/utils/config.ts` and forwards to appropriate transport
- Graceful shutdown handling for both transport types

### 3. Base Classes Architecture ✅
#### ToolBase (`src/tools/base.ts`)
Unified base class for both tools and resources:
- Handles self-registration with the server
- Manages metadata (name, description, input schema)
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Schema validation with Zod and JSON schema conversion
- Abstract methods: `execute()`
- Resources implemented as special tools with "resource:" prefix

### 4. Registration System ✅
- Tools and resources self-register during initialization
- Server maintains internal registries
- Automatic capability detection
- Support for dynamic registration/unregistration
- Example implementations: echo tool, game-state resource

## Testing (Completed) ✅

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── integration/
│   ├── http.test.ts      # HTTP transport integration tests
│   └── stdio.test.ts     # Stdio transport integration tests
├── tools/
│   ├── base.test.ts      # ToolBase class tests
│   └── echo.test.ts      # Echo tool implementation tests
├── resources/
│   └── game-state.test.ts # Game state resource tests
├── setup.ts              # Test utilities and MCP client setup
└── test-utils.ts         # Shared test utilities
```

### Test Coverage Achieved
- **Integration Tests**: Full MCP client testing for both transports
- **Component Tests**: Base class functionality, tool/resource implementations
- **Registration System**: Auto-registration and capability detection
- **Error Handling**: Validation and error propagation
- **Transport Features**: CORS for HTTP, graceful shutdown for both

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Server starts with both stdio and HTTP transports
2. ✅ Extended configuration supports transport settings
3. ✅ Resources and tools work via both transport modes
4. ✅ HTTP transport handles CORS and multiple clients
5. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (>90%) across all components
6. ✅ Graceful shutdown for both transport modes
7. ✅ Error handling and validation throughout

## Dependencies

**Core Dependencies**: express, cors, zod-to-json-schema
**Dev Dependencies**: @types/express, @types/cors  
**Already Available**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, Vitest, TypeScript, winston (existing logging)

## Usage Examples

**Stdio Transport** (Default):
```bash
node dist/index.js  # Default mode
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio node dist/index.js  # Explicit
```

**HTTP Transport**:
```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http node dist/index.js  # Basic
MCP_TRANSPORT=http MCP_PORT=8080 node dist/index.js  # Custom port
```

## Key Achievements

### Architecture Decisions
- **Unified ToolBase**: Single base class for both tools and resources, simplifying the architecture
- **Resource as Tools**: Resources implemented with "resource:" prefix, leveraging same infrastructure
- **Singleton Server**: Clean separation between server instance and transport layers
- **Self-Registration**: Components register themselves, reducing boilerplate

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with full type checking
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive integration and unit tests
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error propagation and validation
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and clear abstractions

## Ready for Stage 2

### Foundation for Bridge Service Integration
- **ToolBase Architecture**: Common infrastructure ready for Bridge Service tools/resources
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: onRegistered/onExecute ready for Bridge connection management
- **Flexible Transport**: Both stdio (for debugging) and HTTP (for Bridge Service)
- **Configuration Framework**: Config system ready to add Bridge Service settings
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Winston logger ready for integration debugging
- **Test Patterns**: Established patterns for testing external service interactions

### Next Steps (Stage 2)
1. Add Bridge Service client to connect to game
2. Implement real game state resources using Bridge Service data
3. Create game action tools that call Bridge Service endpoints
4. Add connection management and retry logic
5. Implement SSE subscription for real-time game updates

## Summary
Stage 1 successfully created a functional MCP server with:
- Full MCP protocol compliance using official SDK
- Multi-transport support (stdio and HTTP)
- Extensible base classes for tools and resources
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean architecture ready for Bridge Service integration

The server is now ready to connect to the actual game through the Bridge Service in Stage 2.
