 * Event triggered when a player successfully founds a religion

 * a holy city, and enhanced religious spread and influence. Founding a religion is a
 * significant milestone that provides permanent bonuses and strategic advantages.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { ReligionFounded } from './knowledge/schema/events/ReligionFounded.js';
 *
 * // Validate event data
 * const eventData = ReligionFounded.parse({
 *   PlayerID: 0,
 *   HolyCityID: 3,

 *   PantheonBelief: 5,
 *   FounderBelief1: 10,
 *   FounderBelief2: 11,
 *   FollowerBelief1: 20,
 *   FollowerBelief2: 21
