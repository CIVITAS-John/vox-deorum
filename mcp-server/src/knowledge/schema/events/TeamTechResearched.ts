 * Triggered when a team completes technology research through the Lua scripting system.
 * In Civilization V, teams share technology progress, so this event affects all
 * civilizations on the same team.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { TeamTechResearched } from './knowledge/schema/events/TeamTechResearched.js';
 *
 * // Validate event data
 * const eventData = TeamTechResearched.parse({
 *   TeamID: 0,
 *   TechID: 15,
 *   ChangeAmount: 1
 * });
 * ```
