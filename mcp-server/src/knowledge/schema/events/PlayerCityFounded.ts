 * resource access, and production capacity. This event provides the location and
 * owner of the newly founded city.

 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { PlayerCityFounded } from './knowledge/schema/events/PlayerCityFounded.js';
 *
 * // Validate event data
 * const eventData = PlayerCityFounded.parse({
 *   PlayerID: 0,
 *   PlotX: 25,
 *   PlotY: 30
 * });
