# MCP Server

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposes Civilization V game state and controls to AI agents. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for game analysis, decision-making, and automated gameplay through standardized MCP interfaces.

## What's Implemented

- **33 MCP Tools** across 5 categories with Zod validation
- **Real-time Event Integration** - SSE and Windows named pipe (event pipe) for game events
- **Civ5 Database Access** - Kysely ORM with multi-language localization and TXT_KEY resolution
- **Knowledge Management** - Per-game persistent state tracking with auto-save and player visibility filtering
- **Tool Framework** - Abstract base classes with factory pattern and type-safe schemas
- **Bridge Integration** - Queue-based Lua execution with batching and auto-pause
- **Multi-Transport Support** - Both stdio and HTTP transports for MCP clients

## Architecture

```
AI Agents ← MCP Protocol → MCP Server ← HTTP/SSE → Bridge Service ← Named Pipe → Civ5 DLL
                                ↓              ↑
                    Knowledge Store      Event Pipe (Windows)
                  (SQLite per game)
                        ↓
                 Civ5 Game Database
                  (SQLite, read-only)
```

### Core Components

- **Server** (`server.ts`) - Singleton MCPServer managing multiple client connections
- **Tool Framework** (`base.ts`, `tools/`) - Abstract base classes with factory pattern
- **Bridge Manager** (`bridge/manager.ts`) - Queue-based Lua execution with SSE/event pipe
- **Database Manager** (`database/manager.ts`) - Multi-database access with caching and localization
- **Knowledge Manager** (`knowledge/manager.ts`) - Per-game state persistence with auto-save
- **Knowledge Store** (`knowledge/store.ts`) - SQLite persistence with versioning and visibility

> See [docs/TOOLS.md](docs/TOOLS.md) for detailed parameter reference.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start         # Production mode

# Development
npm run dev       # Hot reload with tsx
npm test          # Run test suite
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "server": {
    "name": "vox-deorum-mcp-server",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "bridgeService": {
    "endpoint": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 5000
    },
    "eventPipe": {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "vox-deorum-events"
    }
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info"
  }
}
```

Hardcoded settings:
- Knowledge auto-save interval: 30 seconds
- Bridge retry delay: 5 seconds
- Database paths: auto-detected from standard Civ5 installation

## Key Implementation Details

### Bridge Integration
- Queue-based request management with batching (up to 50 Lua calls)
- SSE and event pipe (Windows named pipe) for real-time events
- Auto-pause game when queue reaches capacity
- Automatic reconnection with 5s retry

### Database Features
- Multi-database support (Gameplay, Localization)
- Automatic TXT_KEY resolution with fallbacks
- Connection pooling and localization caching
- Schema introspection with column metadata

### Knowledge System
- Per-game SQLite databases (`data/{gameId}.db`)
- Player visibility filtering (22-player fog of war)
- Versioned mutable knowledge with change tracking
- Automatic 30s interval saves
- Event-based knowledge updates from game events

> See [docs/KNOWLEDGE.md](docs/KNOWLEDGE.md) for architecture details.

### Error Handling
- MCP-compliant error responses
- Graceful Bridge Service disconnection
- Database connection recovery
- Tool execution isolation

## Testing

```bash
npm test                  # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Coverage report
```

Tests include:
- Real MCP client integration (both stdio and HTTP transports)
- Tool schema validation
- Bridge mock responses
- Database query verification

> See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for testing patterns and debugging.

## Integration Points

### With Bridge Service
- Primary communication channel to game
- Lua script execution gateway
- Real-time event streaming (SSE + event pipe)
- Game pause/resume control

### With Vox Agents
- MCP client connects via stdio/HTTP
- Tool execution for game queries and actions
- Knowledge storage for AI memory
- Event notifications for turn updates

### With Game Database
- Direct SQLite access to game rules (read-only)
- Localization for all text content
- Unit/building/tech/strategy specifications
